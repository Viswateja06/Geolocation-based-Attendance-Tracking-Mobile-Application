# Geolocation-based-Attendance-Tracking-Mobile-Application

# Problem Statement
Problem Description: This project focuses on developing a modern, automated attendance tracking system leveraging geolocation technology, specifically GPS and geofencing. The application aims to overcome the limitations and inefficiencies of traditional attendance methods like manual registers and biometric devices, which can be error-prone, tampered with, and time-consuming.
The mobile app uses GPS to continuously detect user location and geofencing to set virtual boundaries around locations such as offices, schools, or work sites.

# Features
Develop a mobile application leveraging GPS and geofencing to automate attendance tracking.
Protect user privacy and data security, complying with regulations.
Make the system scalable and adaptable for organizations of different sizes and requirements
