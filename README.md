## Configuration

### Office Location Settings
The default office location is set in `server.js`:
```javascript
// Default office coordinates (New York City example)
latitude: 40.7128
longitude: -74.0060
radius: 100 // meters
```

To change the office location:
1. Update the coordinates in the database initialization section
2. Restart the server

### Security Settings
- Change the JWT secret in production:
  ```javascript
  const JWT_SECRET = 'your-secure-secret-key';
  ```

## API Endpoints
